# TalentScout â€“ AI Hiring Assistant Chatbot

TalentScout is an AI-powered hiring assistant chatbot that automates initial candidate screening for technical roles. It interacts with candidates in natural language, collects their information, and evaluates their skills by generating relevant technical questions based on their declared tech stack (like Python, React, or AWS).

Built using Python, Streamlit, and Google Gemini, the chatbot maintains context throughout the conversation and guides the candidate through a structured but friendly assessment.

## Features

## Technical Implementation
### Core Components
- **Streamlit**: Web interface for chat interactions
- **GOOGLE GEMINI**: Generates conversational responses and technical questions
- **Session State**: Maintains conversation context throughout the chat

### Key Files
- `app`: Main application logic and UI
- `prompts.py`: Contains all LLM prompt templates
- `utils`: Helper functions for input processing
- `requirements.txt`: Lists all Python dependencies

### Prompt Engineering
The system uses carefully designed prompts including:

1. Information Collection:
```python
"Extract from the candidate's message: name (string), experience (string), and tech stack (list) etc. Return as JSON."
```

https://github.com/sachinbareth/talent-scout-HiringBot.git
cd talent-scout-HiringBot
```
### Install dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Add your GOOGLE API Key
- Create a .env file in the root directory with the following content:
  
  ```bash
  GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
  ```

### Run the App

```bash
streamlit run main.py
```
